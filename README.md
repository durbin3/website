TODO

Resume
- remove high school information
- in professional experience section, you use "Gained experience doing X" a lot. Use more creative verbs (look up resume verbs)
- keep dates consistent, try to be a little more consistent than just the year. "Summer" is okay, but then you need a similar season stamp on other dates
- Clarify "misc experience"
- re order categories to put items in order of relevance; work experience doesn't have to be first
- don't start bullet points with "the"
- cut project descriptions to one sentence descriptions
- "Successfully created .... model to predict whether a person will repay a bank loan" is good.
- add zip code to address
- fix floating phone number
- links should be clickable
- explain fba and shopify
- consider hierarchy, make section titles stand out more
- consider including more technical skills
- either get rid of high school gpa or add college gpa
