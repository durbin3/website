        <div class="challenge-title">Hello World Hackathon</div>
        <div class="text">
            I participated in the Purdue University Hello World Hackathon in late 2019. The event
            was a 24 hour coding "Hackathon", where my team of 5 people had 24 hours to create a
            project and present it to the judges at the end for scoring. The project we made was the
            bare-bones version of Project Synergi, and at the end of the event my team got 2nd place
            out of about 50 groups.

        <div class="text">
            Overall, the whole event taught me much more than full-stack development fundamentals. I
            learned how to work on a team towards a common goal and how to both teach people when
            they need taught and lead people when they lose sight of the goal.

    <!-- Google Foobar -->

        <div class="challenge-title">Google Foobar</div>
        <div class="text">
            I received an invitation to Google Foobar early 2020. Google Foobar is Google's in-house
            code challenge where they ask algorithmic based questions of increasing complexity with
            a focus on time complexity and data structures.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I am still working on it, but at the moment I am on level 4 out of 5 of the challenge.
            Some examples of problems I had to solve include (but are not limited to):
            <ul>
                <li>an example of the paritioning problem</li>
                <li>
                    bit-shifting: performing complex calculations by shifting the bits of numbers
                </li>
                <li>pathfinding: finding the shortest path to an object</li>
                <li>
                    finding if a set of numbers contains a triple of a, b, c where a is a multiple
                    of b, and b is a multiple of c
                </li>
            </ul>

    <!-- Project Euler -->
    <div class="challenge">
        <div class="text">
            Project Euler is similar to Google Foobar, but is not tied to any corporation. The
            premise is still the same however, with there being complex algorithmic-based math
            problems to be solved using programming.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Some of the challenges that I have completed include:
            <ul>
                <li>Largest Prime Factor of a set of numbers</li>
                <li>Largest Pallindrome Product</li>
                <li>10001st prime number</li>
                <li>Finding Pythagorean Triplets</li>
                <li>Highly divisible triangular numbers</li>
                <li>Summation of Prime Numbers</li>
            </ul>
