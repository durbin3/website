                    I participated in the Purdue University Hello World Hackathon in late 2019. The event
                    was a 24 hour coding "Hackathon", where my team of 5 people had 24 hours to create a
                    project and present it to the judges at the end for scoring. The project we made was the
                    bare-bones version of Project Synergi, and at the end of the event my team got 2nd place
                    out of about 50 groups.

                    Overall, the whole event taught me much more than full-stack development fundamentals. I
                    learned how to work on a team towards a common goal and how to both teach people when
                    they need taught and lead people when they lose sight of the goal.

                    I received an invitation to Google Foobar early 2020. Google Foobar is Google's in-house
                    code challenge where they ask algorithmic based questions of increasing complexity with
                    a focus on time complexity and data structures.

                    Some examples of problems I had to solve include (but are not limited to):

                            bit-shifting: performing complex calculations by shifting the bits of numbers

                    Project Euler is similar to Google Foobar, but is not tied to any corporation. The
                    premise is still the same however, with there being complex algorithmic-based math
                    problems to be solved using programming.
