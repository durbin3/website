    <div class="text">
        Image enhancing, a technology once reserved to NCIS, is possible through the use of GANs
        (Generative Adversarial Networks). GANs are constructed by taking two Convolutional Neural
        Networks (CNNs) and pitting them against each other in a never ending game of trying to outsmart
        the other. One CNN (the generator) is attempting to generate high resolution images from the
        given low resolution image, and the other CNN (the discriminator) is attempting to detect
        whether a given image is real, or generated by the Generator. Through their competition, the
        Generator will start generating more convincing images, and the Discriminator will get better at
        noticing the flaws that make the image appear fake. Ultimately if the Generator wins the
        competition, the Discriminator will be unable to determine which images are fake, and which are
        real.
