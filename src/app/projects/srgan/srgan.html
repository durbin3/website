        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <div class="text">
            In this project I constructed a machine learning model to take in low resolution images
            and enhance them, creating higher resolution images that contain more visual detail than
            the original, low-resolution image.
        </div>

        <h3>How GANs Work</h3>
        <div class="text">
            Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are constructed by taking two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
            and pitting them against each other in a never ending game of trying to outsmart the other. 
            One CNN (the generator) is attempting to generate high resolution images from the
            given low resolution image, and the other CNN (the discriminator) is attempting to detect
            whether a given image is real, or generated by the Generator. Through their competition, the
            Generator will start generating more convincing images, and the Discriminator will get better at
            noticing the flaws that make the image appear fake. Ultimately if the Generator wins the
            competition, the Discriminator will be unable to determine which images are fake, and which are
            real.

        <h3>Enhanced Image Examples</h3>
        <div class="text">
            Below are pictures of the successful Super Resoluted images (SR), compared with their low
            resolution (LR) and the actual high resolution (HR) images. Notice that the SR image is clearer than the LR image.
