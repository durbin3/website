<div className="text">
    Image enhancing, a technology once reserved to NCIS,
    is possible through the use of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).
    GANs are constructed by taking two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    and pitting them against each other in a never ending game of trying 
    to outsmart the other. One CNN (the generator) is attempting to generate high
    resolution images from the given low resolution image, and the other
    CNN (the discriminator) is attempting to detect whether a given image
    is real, or generated by the Generator. Through their competition, 
    the Generator will start generating more convincing images, and the
    Discriminator will get better at noticing the flaws that make the
    image appear fake. Ultimately if the Generator wins the competition, 
    the Discriminator will be unable to determine which images are fake,
    and which are real.
